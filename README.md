GravitySim is a real-time 2D gravity simulation written in C with SDL2. It started as a fun curiosity project, but the direction changed pretty quickly. The goal now is to keep the interaction side enjoyable while pushing the simulation itself toward more defensible physics and better numerical behaviour.

The current build already supports physically meaningful units, velocity Verlet integration, preset scenes, interactive spawning, collision merging, camera controls, and live diagnostics for energy, momentum, angular momentum, and drift. It is still actively being built out, but the foundation is in place and the roadmap is clear.

## Current Feature Set

- Real-time N-body gravity simulation in C
- SDL2 rendering with trails, HUD, and camera controls
- Physically meaningful simulation units
- Velocity Verlet integration for better orbital stability
- Interactive body spawning with drag based launch velocity
- Preset scenes for empty space, a starter system, three body motion, and binary stars
- Perfectly inelastic collision merging with mass, momentum, and density aware radius updates
- Diagnostics for total energy, total momentum, angular momentum, and relative drift from a resettable baseline

## Core Physics Concepts

GravitySim uses Newtonian gravity. Each body feels the sum of gravitational acceleration from every other body:

$$
\mathbf{a}_i = \sum_{j \ne i} G\,m_j \frac{\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i}{\lVert \mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i \rVert^3}
$$

The simulation currently uses velocity Verlet integration, which is a much better fit for orbital systems than a simple Euler step. It's still light enough for real time use, but it behaves much better over longer runs.

Collisions are handled as perfectly inelastic merges. Mass and linear momentum are conserved, merged radius is recomputed from mass and density, and off-centre impacts keep angular momentum bookkeeping through a stored spin term.

There is also a drift system in the HUD. Implemented during debugging but kept it since I felt if I was asking myself: “does this look right?”, other people might too. It measures how far the current state has numerically moved away from a chosen baseline, which makes it easier to judge integrator quality and general simulation health.

More informal write-ups live in [Theory notes/Notes.md](Theory%20notes/Notes.md).

## Build

### Dependencies

- C compiler with C11 support
- `SDL2`
- `SDL2_ttf`
- `make`
- `pkg-config`

### Build And Run

```bash
make
make run
```

### Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -S sdl2 sdl2_ttf pkgconf
make
make run
```

My main development environment is Arch Linux, but the code is intended to stay portable anywhere SDL2 and SDL2_ttf are available.

## Controls

- `LMB drag`: spawn a body and set its initial velocity
- `RMB`: cancel spawn
- `Shift + mouse wheel` or `[ ]`: change spawn mass
- `Mouse wheel` or `Q / E`: zoom
- `Middle mouse drag` or `W A S D` / arrow keys: pan camera
- `C`: reset camera
- `- / =`: slow down or speed up simulated time
- `T`: reset time scale
- `0 / 1 / 2 / 3`: switch scenes
- `R`: reset the current scene
- `B`: reset the diagnostics baseline
- `Space`: pause
- `H`: hide the HUD
- `Esc`: quit
